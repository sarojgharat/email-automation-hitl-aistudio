# Email Automation Solution - Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

This project is a web application designed to streamline and automate the process of email classification and data extraction, operating with a "Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL) approach. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing emails, classifying them into predefined categories, and extracting key information into a structured format.

The application is built with modern web technologies, including React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and interactive user experience, with Firebase handling user authentication.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Setup Instructions

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-automation-hitl.git
cd email-automation-hitl
```

**Step 2: Configure Firebase**

This application requires a Firebase project to handle user authentication.

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project (or use an existing one).
2.  In your project, add a new Web App.
3.  Go to **Project Settings** (click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è) > **General** tab.
4.  Scroll down to the "Your apps" section and find your web app.
5.  Under "Firebase SDK snippet," select **Config**.
6.  Copy the `firebaseConfig` object.
7.  Open the `src/firebase.ts` file in your editor.
8.  **Replace the placeholder `firebaseConfig` object with the one you copied from your Firebase project.**

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The application will not work without a valid Firebase configuration. You will see an error screen if the placeholder credentials are still present.

**Step 3: Install Dependencies**

Install the project dependencies using npm.

```bash
npm install
```

**Step 4: Run the Application**

Run the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start, and you can access the application by opening the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) in your web browser.

## üìñ How to Use the Application

1.  **Sign Up / Login:** On the landing page, create a new account or sign in with existing credentials.
2.  **View the Dashboard:** After logging in, you'll see the Dashboard, which gives a high-level overview of the email processing status.
3.  **Navigate to the Inbox:** Click on the "Inbox" button in the navigation bar to see the list of all emails.
4.  **Sort and Filter:** Use the column headers to sort the email list. Use the input fields below the headers to filter the emails by sender, subject, or other criteria.
5.  **Process an Email:**
    - Click on any email in the list to open the Detail View.
    - In the "Classification" section, choose the category that best fits the email (e.g., 'Booking Creation').
    - If the classification is relevant for data extraction, a form will appear.
    - Read the email body on the left and fill in the required details in the form on the right.
    - Click "Save Data" to store the extracted information.
6.  **Review Progress:** Navigate back to the Dashboard or Inbox to see your progress reflected in the stats and status icons.
